# ðŸ““ DECISIONS.md â€“ Bootstrap CLI Architectural Decisions

This doc captures high-level technical and strategic decisions made during the project.

---

### âœ… 1. Language: Go
- Chosen for portability, static binaries, speed
- Easy CLI development with `cobra`, `promptui`, and `bubbletea`

### âœ… 2. Structure: DDD-lite + Modular
- `internal/` is domain-based: system, install, shell, flow, etc.
- `pkg/` reserved for public modules (templates, optional plugins)
- Clear separation of CLI (`cmd/`) and logic (`internal/`)
- Reusable shared interfaces live in `internal/interfaces/`

### âœ… 3. Configuration: YAML over JSON
- Easier for dev users to edit
- Used with `viper` for flexibility

### âœ… 4. Prompts: `Bubbletea + Bubbles + Lip Gloss`
- Excellent for interactive CLI UX
- Supports all major input types, styling

### âœ… 5. Shells: Zsh (Default), Bash, Fish
- Prioritize Zsh due to ecosystem and plugin support
- Provide fallback logic if not found

### âœ… 6. Fonts: Nerd Fonts (JetBrains Mono)
- JetBrains Mono Nerd + Fira Code Nerd preselected
- User can override in config

### âœ… 7. Test Environments: LXC
- Ubuntu container for fast, reproducible install tests
- Snapshot for rollback testing

### âœ… 8. Error Strategy
- Friendly CLI error messages
- Internal error logging for debug
- Recovery suggestion on crash

### âœ… 9. Interface Definitions
- Shared interfaces (e.g., `ToolInstaller`, `ShellManager`, `SymlinkApplier`) are defined once in `internal/interfaces/`
- Prevents duplication and improves code reuse across packages

### âœ… 10. Testing Strategy
- **Unit tests** live alongside logic files in the form of `*_test.go`
- **Integration tests** live under `test/integration/` and test cross-module or CLI-level flows
- **End-to-end tests** live under `test/e2e/` and simulate full user journeys via `init`, `up`, etc.
- **Fixtures** (e.g., example YAML config files) live in `test/fixtures/`
- **Mocks and fakes** used across modules live in `internal/testutil/` for shared use across packages

### âœ… 11. Declarative Extensibility
- Bootstrap CLI is designed to be **configuration-driven**
- Adding tools, language runtimes, fonts, or prompts should be possible by editing config files or templates â€” not by writing new Go code
- All installable items should be registered through centralized metadata or schema (e.g., a `tools.yaml` or Go struct registry)
- Encourages scalability and lowers barrier to contribution or user customization

### âœ… 12. Pipeline-Based Installation Architecture
- Adopted a pipeline-based approach for tool installation and configuration
- Each tool installation is broken down into discrete, verifiable steps
- Key components:
  - `Tool` struct with platform-specific installation strategies
  - `InstallationContext` for managing state and environment
  - `VerifyStrategy` for robust post-install verification
  - `InstallStrategy` for flexible, platform-aware installation steps
- Benefits:
  - Better error handling and recovery
  - Platform-specific installation paths
  - Consistent verification across tools
  - Modular and testable installation steps
  - Clear separation between tool definition and installation logic

### âœ… 13. Shell Configuration Management
- Shell configuration is treated as a first-class concern
- Structured approach using `ShellConfig` type:
  - Aliases
  - Functions
  - Environment variables
- Enables consistent shell setup across different shells and platforms

### ðŸŸ¡ Pending Decisions
- Remote config sync method (S3? Git?)
- Plugin architecture (WASM? Go interfaces?)
- Dotfiles symlink manager vs full copy
- TUI wrapper (Bubbletea? Custom rendering?)

---

### ðŸ§© Open Topics
- Optional telemetry/metrics?
- Visual theme customization?
- Accessibility defaults (reduced motion, contrast)?
