# Bootstrap CLI - Vision Document

## Project Vision

Bootstrap CLI aims to be the definitive tool for developers to set up and maintain their development environment across Linux and macOS platforms. It provides a seamless, automated way to configure shells, install development tools, and manage dotfiles while following each platform's best practices.

## Core Principles

1. **Platform Agnostic**
   - Work consistently across Linux and macOS
   - Abstract platform-specific details behind clean interfaces
   - Provide consistent user experience regardless of platform

2. **Extensible Architecture**
   - Plugin system for adding new tools and capabilities
   - Clear separation between public API and internal implementation
   - Well-defined interfaces for platform-specific code

3. **Developer Experience**
   - Intuitive CLI interface with sensible defaults
   - Clear error messages and recovery options
   - Comprehensive documentation and examples
   - Non-destructive operations with backup options
